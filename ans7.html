  <ul>
    <li> A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing programs youâ€™ve already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen</li>
    <li>Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships</li>
    <li> One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code</li>
    <li>Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer because it teaches you how to think</li>
    <li>Fix the cause, not the symptom</li>
